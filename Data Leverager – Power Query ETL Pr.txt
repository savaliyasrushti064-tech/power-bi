Data Leverager – Power Query ETL Project Explanation

1. Project Overview
This project is created using Power BI Power Query Editor.
The main objective of this project is to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on Excel data.
The focus is only on data cleaning, transformation, and integration.

2. Data Sources Used
The following data sources are used in this project:
Sales Data (Folder Source):
sales_jan.xlsx
sales_feb.xlsx
sales_mar.xlsx
Employee Data (Excel File):
employees.xlsx

3. Data Extraction
The sales files were loaded using the Folder connector in Power BI.
All monthly sales files were combined using Append Queries from Folder into a single table.
The employee data was loaded separately using the Excel connector.

4. Data Cleaning and Preparation
The following data cleaning steps were applied in Power Query:
Removed blank rows and unnecessary columns
Promoted the first row as headers
Renamed columns to meaningful names
Changed data types to correct formats (Date, Number, Text)
Removed duplicate and null values where required

5. Text Transformations
Text transformation tools were applied to the Employee Name column:
Converted text to uppercase
Removed extra spaces using Trim
Removed unwanted characters using Clean
This ensured consistent and clean text data.

6. Numeric Transformations
The Sales Amount column was rounded to two decimal places
A new Profit column was created based on Sales Amount calculation

7. Date and Time Transformations
From the Order Date column, the following new columns were created:
Year
Month
Day
Quarter

8. Conditional Column (Sales Category)
A new column named Sales Category was created using conditional logic:
Sales Amount greater than or equal to 50000 → High
Sales Amount greater than or qual to 35000 → Medium
Sales Amount else  → Low
This was created using the Conditional Column option in Power Query.

9. Index Columns
index columns were added:
One index starting from 1
These columns help in record tracking.

10. Merging and Appending
Sales data was merged with Employee data using Employee ID
Employee details such as Name, Department, and Region were added to the sales table
Monthly sales data was already combined using folder append

11. Grouping and Aggregation
Data was grouped by Region to calculate:
Total Sales
Average Order Value
Transaction Count
